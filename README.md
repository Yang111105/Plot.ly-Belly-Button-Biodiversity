## Plot.ly-Belly-Button-Biodiversity

This project builds an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The samples.json is read by using D3 library.

### The dashboard includes:
- A dropdown menu to display the all IDs
- A horizontal bar chart of top 10 bacteria cultures found
- A bubble chart that displays each sample
- Display the selected individual's demographic information
- A Gauge Chart of selected person's scrubs per week
